The CKM8 Blockchain Ledger is a Proof-of-Stake decentralized ledger designed for the video streaming industry. It powers the CKM8 token economy which incentives end users to share their redundant bandwidth and storage resources, and encourage them to engage more actively with video platforms and content creators. The ledger employs a novel multi-level BFT consensus engine, which supports high transaction throughput, fast block confirmation, and allows mass participation in the consensus process. Off-chain payment support is built directly into the ledger through the resource-oriented micropayment pool, which is designed specifically to achieve the “pay-per-byte” granularity for streaming use cases. Moreover, the ledger storage system leverages the microservice architecture and reference counting based history pruning techniques, and is thus able to adapt to different computing environments, ranging from high-end data center server clusters to commodity PCs and laptops. The ledger also supports Turing-Complete smart contracts, which enables rich user experiences for DApps built on top of the CKM8 Ledger. Signature Gossip".
